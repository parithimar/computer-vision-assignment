The size of the third dimension of the output of the second layer is therefore equal to the number of filters in the second layer. Usually it is used type 2.1 convolution"

The lower the value, the slower we travel along the downward slope. While this might be a good idea (using a low learning rate) in terms of making sure that we do not miss any local minima, it could also mean that we’ll be taking a long time to converge — especially if we get stuck on a plateau region"
